SJSU ID:- 015964975

Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

Here, the Google colab is prepared in 4 different steps:

1) Data Cleaning:  In Data Cleaning, I have cleared all the null values present in 4 different columns inside this dataset.

2) Outlier Mining: In the outlier analysis, I have detected the outliers in both- Statistical and Graphical manner  and thereafter, removed the outliers in the proper manner.

3) Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Here, I have tried to derive some conclusions from the different columns in the dataset. In this section, some answers were drawn as a conclusion to the questions like:
      
      a)On an average basis,How many people in total are there in a single booking?
      
      b)How many Bookings were cancelled with respect to each hotel?
      
      c)Number of special requests made by customers in their booking .... and many more.
      
4) Data Modelling: In the Data Modelling, I have trained the data using following Models:
  
       a) Random Forest Classifier
  
       b) Random Forest Regressor
  
And the precision or accuracy is about 83% in both the models and have displayed the confusion matrix in both the cases.

Data Cleaning in OpenRefine:

So, I have atttached a PDF document containing the screenshots of each step of Data Cleaning performed in OpenRefine and  it also contains its description and steps wherever needed.
